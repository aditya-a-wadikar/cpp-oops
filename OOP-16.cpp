/*
Inheritance
    - class can be derived from another class
    - derived class can access the properties of base class
    - thus, one can create hirarchical structor to code
    - provide reuseability widely known as DRY (do not repeat yourself)

Types
    - single : single parent class with single child class
    - multiple : multiple parent classes with single child class
    - hirarchical : single parent class with multiple child class
    - multilevel : chain
    - hybrid : combination of multiple and multi-level inheritance
